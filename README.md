# Explicit Generators of the Space of Modular Forms
This code computes the coefficient matrix $\mathbf{A}$, its elimination matrix $\mathbf{P}$, and the entries of the anti-diagonal of $\mathbf{PA}$ in our paper "Explicit Generators of the Space of Modular Forms" (Tianyu Ni, Ashley Song, Yanhui Su, Hui Xue, Amanda Yin).
